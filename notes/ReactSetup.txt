1. Install create-react-app global from npm: npm install -g create-react-app
2. Create a project from command line using: "create-react-app <my-project-name>"

3. There is some problem with CRA package where it hard-codedly requires babel-eslint version (10.0.3 at the time of writing) to run.
If we run npm i --save-dev babel-eslint, it will install the latest version 10.1.0 (at the time of writing)
Now, if you start to run CRA, it will cry saying it needs some specific version

To fix this,
4. Move inside the project and install dev dependencies, the following packages:
npm i --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-react-hooks eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-config-prettier eslint-config-airbnb eslint-plugin-html

Please note that we are not installing "babel-eslint". Technically that should also be installed, but CRA would have already installed that.


4. The above step will help you to use eslint and prettier in vscode.
5. Copy .eslintrc.json and .prettierrc.json from this project
6. That's all, you have successfully created a react project with eslint and prettier setup.
7. The linkage between eslint and prettier is explained in website: https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/configure-prettier-in-vscode/#use-eslint-with-prettier

8. So basically, eslint will be used to run it's operations along with prettier, i.e. when we save the file, it will solve both stylish and semantic problems.
9. This is the reason we should disable any form JS formatting from editor and also disable js formatting from prettier in editor.
Prettier will still be used for html etc.

Hence, the below settings should be used in settings.json file:

// These are all my auto-save configs
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
// turn it off for JS and JSX, we will do this via eslint
"[javascript]": {
  "editor.formatOnSave": false
},
"[javascriptreact]": {
  "editor.formatOnSave": false
},
// tell the ESLint plugin to run on save
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.fixAll": true
},
// Optional BUT IMPORTANT: If you have the prettier extension enabled for other languages like CSS and HTML, turn it off for JS since we are doing it through Eslint already
"prettier.disableLanguages": ["javascript", "javascriptreact"],
