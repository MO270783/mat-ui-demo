How to handle exceptions in Spring boot.

Points to note:
1. There is a default error controller called BasicErrorController which has two controller methods for html and json error handling
If the error/exceptions is unhandled at the top (by controller advices), then it comes here and depending on request accept type (html or json),
the error controller calls it's respective methods.
If it's HTML, a white label error page is sent, and if JSON, a json message(ErrorAttribute) is sent.

2. There is a default error attributes (DefaultErrorAttributes) that is sent back to the client. Basic set of values.

3. We have 2 things to worry here, response status and response body

4. We should create a common error class to create error objects.

There are two things to handle here:
1. Custom exceptions: Extend a class REsponseEntityHandler and use exception handler annotations
2. Default spring responses: Create a custom error attribute class and custom controller.

Below two sites give you a good idea of what needs to be done.
